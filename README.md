# Instruction

Here's a README file for your `EthLoadBalancer` project. It includes an overview, setup instructions, usage examples, and some basic information to help others understand and use your project.

# EthLoadBalancer

EthLoadBalancer is a distributed load balancing system written in Go, designed to handle Ethereum block data requests across multiple nodes. It simulates resource constraints (CPU and memory) and proxies requests to other nodes when a single node is overloaded, ensuring efficient request distribution in a cluster.

## Features

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes Ethereum block data requests across multiple nodes based on resource availability.
- **Resource Management**: Enforces artificial CPU and memory limits per node.
- **Proxying**: Forwards requests to peer nodes when local resources are exhausted.
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides a `/health` endpoint to check node status.
- **Request Tracing**: Tracks request chains to show the path through nodes.
- **Dockerized**: Easily deployable with Docker Compose for multi-node testing.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.20 or later) - for building the application
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - for running the multi-node setup
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - for orchestrating multiple nodes

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EthLoadBalancer.git
   cd EthLoadBalancer
   ```

2. **Build the Application**
   If running locally without Docker:

   ```bash
   go mod init EthLoadBalancer
   go get github.com/gorilla/mux
   go build -o ethloadbalancer
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**
   The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up 4 nodes:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration, set in `docker-compose.yml` or your environment:

- `PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 8080)
- `MAX_CPU`: Maximum concurrent requests (default: 2)
- `MAX_MEMORY`: Maximum memory in MB (default: 200)
- `MEMORY_PER_REQUEST`: Memory per request in MB (default: 50)
- `PEER_NODES`: Comma-separated list of peer node URLs (e.g., `http://node2:8080,http://node3:8080`)

## Usage

### Endpoints

- **GET /eth/block**: Retrieve dummy Ethereum block data
  - Returns JSON with block number, timestamp, hash, and request chain
- **GET /health**: Check node status
  - Returns JSON with resource usage and status ("ready" or "busy")

### Testing

1. **Single Request**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8081/eth/block
   ```

2. **Stress Test**
   Send multiple concurrent requests to node1:

   ```bash
   for i in {1..20}; do curl http://localhost:8081/eth/block & done
   ```

3. **View Logs**
   Check the Docker Compose logs to see request handling and proxying:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

   Look for:
   - ‚úÖ: Request handled directly
   - üîÄ: Request proxied to another node
   - ‚ùå: Request rejected (hop limit or loop)

### Example Output

```json
{
  "node": "node1",
  "chain": "node1 ‚Üí node2",
  "block": {
    "blockNumber": 123456,
    "timestamp": 1742825761,
    "hash": "0x0000000000000000a86c8de588b24567"
  },
  "message": "Handled directly"
}
```
